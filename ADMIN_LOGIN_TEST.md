# üîç Admin Login Test

## Issue Diagnosis

The events are in the database (we confirmed 2 events exist), but the admin dashboard shows "No events created yet". This suggests an **authentication issue**.

## Quick Tests to Try:

### 1. **Check if you're logged in as admin:**
1. Open browser Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab ‚Üí **Local Storage** ‚Üí `http://localhost:3000`
3. Look for `kongu-auth-token`
4. **If missing** ‚Üí You need to log in as admin

### 2. **Try logging in as admin:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin/login`
2. Use your admin credentials
3. After login, check if events appear

### 3. **Check browser console for errors:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Refresh the admin events page
4. Look for any red error messages

### 4. **Check Network tab:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to **Network** tab
3. Refresh the admin events page
4. Look for the `/api/admin/events` request
5. Check if it returns 401 Unauthorized

## Expected Results:

- **If properly logged in:** You should see the 2 events (Hackverse'25 and Hackvotrix)
- **If not logged in:** You'll see 401 errors in the network tab
- **If wrong role:** You might see 403 Forbidden errors

## Quick Fix:

If you're not logged in as admin:
1. Go to `/admin/login`
2. Log in with admin credentials
3. Navigate back to `/admin/events`

The events data is definitely there - we just confirmed it exists in the database!
